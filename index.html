          <p>Keep your conduct and conversation civil. This means, including and limited to: <br>a) You may disagree with anyone or anything you like, but you should try to keep it to opinions, and not people. Avoid vitriol.<br>b) Constant antagonistic behavior is considered uncivil and appropriate action will be taken.<br>- This rule is intended purely for the purpose of attempting to prevent flame wars, and is not to be interpreted in a way that disrupts normal conversation. </p>
